# Chronic Pain Model:

This repository contains Python code for modeling the development and recovery of chronic pain using a theoretical framework derived from our upcoming manuscript:  
**"A recurrent neural network gives rise to a chronic pain attractor depending on calming stimulus"**  
(Authors: Guy Marmor, Tjitse van der Molen, Zongren Zhang, Francesco Bullo)

## Acknowledgments
ChatGPT was used to automatically document code and design a few simple accessory routines. Three members of our team (FB,GM, TvdM) independently verified that the few accessory routines generated by ChatGPT are performing as intended.

## Overview
We propose a mathematical model describing the temporal dynamics of pain sensitization and recovery.  
The model integrates physiological mechanisms of hyperalgesia and desensitization into a unified dynamical system, implemented in Python.

The simulations reproduce and fit data from:
- **Shape shifting pain: chronification of back pain shifts brain representation from nociceptive to emotional circuits. Brain.**(ShapeShifting Data)
- **Effect of Pain Reprocessing Therapy vs Placebo and Usual Care for Patients With Chronic Back Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial. JAMA Psychiatry.**(BoulderRecoveryData)
- **Our own collected dataset**(PatientDataTemplate)
- **Hyperalgesia Figures**(HyperAlgesia)
